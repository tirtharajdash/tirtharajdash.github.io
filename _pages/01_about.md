I am working as an Assistant Professor (Grade-II) in the <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/ComputerScienceInformationsSystems/ComputerScienceandInformationSystems" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a> and also affiliated with Anuradha and Prashanth Palakurthi Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/appcair/index.html" target="_blank">(APPCAIR)</a>, <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/index.aspx" target="_blank">BITS Pilani Goa Campus</a>. I am also a Doctoral Researcher in Machine Learning in the same department. I am working with Senior Professor <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/ashwin/profile" target="_blank">Ashwin Srinivasan</a>.

My research focus is on the areas of Deep Learning, Neuro-Symbolic Models, Machine Learning and Optimisation. My doctoral research focuses on constructing deep neural networks from relational data and symbolic domain-knowledge, resulting in a beautiful combination of neural- and symbolic learning. The early part of my doctoral research focused on designing stochastic optimisation algorithm(s) to search very large, potentially infinite-attribute spaces. An application of this study is in the area of Inductive Logic Programming <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_logic_programming" target="_blank">(ILP)</a>, which is a subfield of symbolic artificial intelligence. The real-world applications of my doctoral research are in the broad area of drug discovery. Further, it has huge potential to be adopted in many other real-world problems such as health science, social networks, robotics, etc.

I received a Master of Technology (M.Tech) degree in Computer Science from <a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.vssut.ac.in/" target="_blank">VSSUT, Burla</a> (one of the oldest engineering institutes in India) in the year 2014 and a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree in Information Technology from <a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.nist.edu" target="_blank">NIST Berhampur</a> in the year 2012. I am a *Silver Medalist* in both M.Tech and B.Tech for my academic performances.

I have worked as an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science at <a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.nist.edu" target="_blank">NIST Berhampur</a> for over a year during 2014 - 2015. I have also worked as IASc-INSA-NASI Summer Research Fellow at <a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.isical.ac.in/" target="_blank">ISI Kolkata</a>. I have qualified national-level competitive examinations such as <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Aptitude_Test_in_Engineering" target="_blank">GATE</a> (twice) and <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Eligibility_Test" target="_blank">UGC-NET</a>.

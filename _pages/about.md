I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/index.aspx" target="_blank">BITS Pilani, Goa Campus</a>. My research focuses on Neurosymbolic AI, Deep Learning, and AI for Science. You may want to visit [this page](/interests/) for more details on my research interests.

Prior to joining BITS Pilani, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Cambridge, UK</a>, where I worked with <a rel="external nofollow" href="http://sblab.uk/sbornelov.php" target="_blank">Susanne Bornelöv</a>. I was also a Postdoctoral Affiliate of Trinity College, Cambridge (I am now an alumnus of the college). Our group drove AI-centric research at the interface of genomics and life sciences, investigating codon usage, transcript stability, and other complex biological phenomena by applying advanced artificial intelligence techniques to massive genomic datasets. I focused on building state-of-the-art learning frameworks--spanning neurosymbolic architectures and deep sequence models--that autonomously extract new biological knowledge directly from raw genomic sequences. Before Cambridge, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">University of California, San Diego</a>, where I worked with Professor <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://sites.google.com/view/debashis-sahoo/members/DebashisSahoo" target="_blank">Debashis Sahoo</a> in the <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://sites.google.com/view/debashis-sahoo/" target="_blank">Boolean Lab</a>. In the Boolean Lab, my research focused on using AI and Boolean analysis for analysing several biological datasets (RNA-seq and Single-cell RNA-seq) in the domain of cancer, inflammatory bowel disease and macrophages. 

I completed my PhD in Computer Science in July 2022 from <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/" target="_blank">BITS Pilani</a>. I completed my doctoral research during Jan 2017 to April 2022 under the supervision of Senior Professor <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/ashwin/profile" target="_blank">Ashwin Srinivasan</a>. The title of my PhD thesis is "Inclusion of Symbolic Domain-Knowledge into Deep Neural Networks". In my doctoral research, I focused on constructing deep neural networks from relational data and symbolic domain-knowledge—this resulted in beautiful combinations of neural computation with logical representation. 
The real-world applications of my doctoral research are in the broad area of drug discovery. Further, it has enormous potential to be adopted in many other real-world problems such as health science, social networks, robotics, etc. See <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://tirtharajdash.github.io/myPhD/" target="_blank">this page</a> for more details about my PhD.

I received a Master of Technology (M.Tech) degree in Computer Science from <a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.vssut.ac.in/" target="_blank">VSSUT, Burla</a> (one of the oldest engineering institutes in India) in the year 2014 and a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree in Information Technology from <a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.nist.edu" target="_blank">NIST Berhampur</a> in the year 2012. I am a *Silver Medalist* in both M.Tech and B.Tech for my academic performances.

I have worked as an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science at <a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.nist.edu" target="_blank">NIST Berhampur</a> for over a year during 2014 - 2015. I have also worked as IASc-INSA-NASI Summer Research Fellow at <a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.isical.ac.in/" target="_blank">ISI Kolkata</a>. I have qualified national-level competitive examinations such as <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Aptitude_Test_in_Engineering" target="_blank">GATE</a> (2012, 2015) and <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Eligibility_Test" target="_blank">UGC-NET</a> (2014).

**Research**

*Deep Learning*

Neural Networks has had a long and rich history, and the reincarnated viewpoint has shifted towards “Deep Neural Networks” and “Deep Learning”. Deep learning and its ever-evolving implementations have been achieving remarkable successes in subareas of science and technology. I am inclined towards conceptual and implementational aspects of deep learning for problems arising in biology, chemistry, computer vision, robotics and games. This includes: deep learning for structured- and unstructured-data, transfer learning, model compression, adversarial learning, deep reinforcement learning.


*Neuro-Symbolic Learning*

Neural networks can learn from non-symbolic or structured data, and they are found to be robust to noise. However, they suffer from two important issues: their learning is severely affected if data is scarce; they are not interpretable. Whereas, symbolic machine learning models are very data efficient and interpretable. Neuro-symbolic models exploit the advantages of neural networks and symbolic models. My research focus in this area is a combination of deep neural networks and Inductive Logic Programming (ILP).


*Graph Representation Learning*

Graph neural networks have shown tremendous potential in learning from relational data or graph-structured data. I am interested in conceptual and implementational development of graph-convolution and graph-pooling procedures. Further, I am very motivated to involve myself in the evolving areas of "Geometric Deep Learning".


*Machine Learning for Science*

I am interested in the development of machine learning and deep learning systems to address specific learning problems, primarily in the area of health, medicines, drug discovery, computational biology. A learning problem can be characterised by observations comprised of either input-output pairs (supervised learning) or only inputs (unsupervised learning). I am mostly interested in solving problems arising in biology, chemistry, internet-of-things (IoT), and finance. I also like exploring applications of stochastic (and evolutionary) optimisation to machine learning.

**Collaboration**

I am looking forward to new problems and research discussions. I am happy to collaborate, if there is any shared interest. In future, there will be a website for my lab: <a href="https://github.com/iMachLab" target="_blank">iMachLab</a>.

**Teaching**

I love teaching any course that is in line with my present research interests: Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence. In the past, I have always enjoyed teaching programming (mostly in C or C++) to first-year undergrad students. A course on data structure and algorithms has always been my crush in my short teaching life. I have taught database systems (including labs on MySQL) and would like to teach if I have to.

**What else, if it matters to you?**

I was born and raised in a remote village of Western Odisha, an Indian state rich in culture, vegetables and farming. My father (who is a Master in Arts and Bhagavad Gita) and extended paternal family are involved mostly in farming and small businesses. We speak a dilect of Odia language, known as Kosali (a folk language). My district is known for Odia folk music and the famous Sambalpuri Saree. I enjoy riding motorbikes (mostly fast-yet-careful racing). I play cricket; I am a batsman and a wicketkeeper. That view of the game from behind the stumps is extraordinary. I have occasionally played football; I am a goalkeeper. I love swimming in the sea (The Arabian sea is my neighbour) and known rivers. Trekking is something that always excites me. Watching movies on weekends has always been there since my undergrad studies (sometimes, I do binge-watch). In addition to all these fun stuff, I am also interested in philosophy, spirituality, farming, and poverty prevention.

I am looking for motivated students to work on AI for science, particularly neurosymbolic AI, graph neural networks, transformer models, and applications in genomics and drug discovery.

---

#### PhD Positions

**Available:** Multiple positions starting with July 2026 admission

**Research areas:**
- Exploring causal deep learning models
- Building neurosymbolic and explainable AI models
- Application domains: drug discovery and molecular biology

**Requirements:**
- Strong programming skills (Python, PyTorch)
- Background in CS/AI/ML or computational biology
- Passion for interdisciplinary research

**Funding:** Institute fellowships and project-based support available

---

#### BE and ME Projects and Thesis

**Available:** 2-3 positions per semester

**Note:** While thesis is officially one semester, I expect students to commit to working for a full year to produce meaningful research outcomes.

**Research topics:**
- Developing causal reasoning methods for deep learning
- Designing neurosymbolic and explainable AI architectures
- Applications in drug discovery, gene regulation, and molecular property prediction

**Requirements:**
- Strong coursework in ML/DL or biology/chemistry
- Programming proficiency in Python
- Commitment to year-long research (not just one semester)

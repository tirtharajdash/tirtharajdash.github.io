description: Reflections Over a Cup of Coffee
---

**"Sssiiip… Nothing beats the first sip of coffee."**  
I tell myself, sitting in a moderately cozy coffee shop, looking outside the window while people go on with their lives. A baby crying in their mother’s arms, couples walking hand in hand, a guitarist playing and losing himself in the music while people listen, absorbing the dark, rainy, chilled day.  

A thought suddenly crosses my mind. Not that it has never come before—perhaps a million times. But today, it feels different.  

**What’s the point?**  

One day, I will die. So will everyone else.  

What’s the ****ing point of all of this? The chase for a name, the chase for grants, the medals, the respect, the positions? Suddenly, it all feels different. I wonder if it’s the gloomy evening or if it’s just me, alone. No, I think it's neither. I enjoy my ~~loneliness~~ **solitude**. I enjoy thinking, living, and being by myself.  

Is this the so-called **existential crisis**, the one that strikes everyone at some point in life? No, I don’t think so. I am enjoying my existence. Then why does this question of **death** suddenly intrude?  

Maybe it has something to do with the coffee.  

Okay, let's just blame the coffee and move forward.  

#### The Unavoidable Truth  

One day, we and everyone we know will be gone. Only a handful of what we do or say will matter, and even that—for just a brief moment in time.  

With the pace at which technology is evolving, especially AI, this duration might be even shorter. **How much shorter?** Maybe the big tech companies know.  

I believe this is the ultimate truth of life: everything we do is just a second-hand way to avoid confronting death, until reality strikes us for good.  

We are just **microscopic cosmic dust** running around a tiny blue ball called Earth, fighting with other dust, saying:  

**“Damn! I am thriving.”**  

We wear a mask, one that signifies our "un"-true identity, and imagine our own importance. Every single day, we reinforce that mask, doing everything to keep the illusion intact.  

From chasing a few hundred likes on a social media post to running after job promotions—it’s all the same. We want to stay **relevant**. We invent purposes, one after another, and live for them.  

**Only to realize that we are nothing.**

#### The Certainty of Death  

Am I enjoying thinking about my own death? Of course not. **Nobody enjoys thinking about their own death.**  

But I believe it is absolutely necessary. Perhaps one of the most important psychological exercises one can do.  

> "Death is the only thing that is certain."  

Chapter 2, Verse 27 of the **Bhagavad Gita** says:

> **jātasya hi dhruvo mṛityur dhruvaṁ janma mṛitasya cha**  
> **tasmād aparihārye ’rthe na tvaṁ śhochitum arhasi**  

_(jātasya—for one who has been born; hi—for; dhruvaḥ—certain; mṛityuḥ—death; dhruvam—certain; janma—birth; mṛitasya—for the dead; cha—and; tasmāt—therefore; aparihārye arthe—in this inevitable situation; na—not; tvam—you; śhochitum—lament; arhasi—befitting)_  

**"Death is certain for one who has been born, and rebirth is inevitable for one who has died. Therefore, you should not lament over the inevitable."**  

#### The Illusion of Importance  

Interestingly, knowingly or unknowingly, my decisions in life have always been shaped by the fact that **one day, I will die**.  

Yet, most people spend their entire lives chasing things that do not matter. The very fact that we are all destined for death should make us **love each other more**. But strangely, it does not.  

Instead:  
- We nitpick trivialities.  
- We hate each other.  
- We despise everyone.  
- ***What the f***?***  

We should be choosing values well beyond ourselves. Yet, we let life’s trivialities **consume us**.  

We **regret everything**.  
We are **happy with nothing**.  
We **chase happiness**, yet we have never sat alone and reflected on the fact that **true happiness comes only when we care for something beyond ourselves**.  

This is the feeling that draws us to temples, inspires us to raise a family, motivates us to save money, and drives us to buy a car.  

**All of us chase greatness.**  

We wonder what legacy we will leave behind.  

But in doing so, we often forget: **we are already winners.**  

We were born winners.  
One in millions of sperm fertilized that egg with a probability of ***1/infinity***.  

The degrees we chase, the medals we earn, the class, the cars, the house—**they do not define greatness**.  

We are already great.  
Because we know what to care for and what not to, amid the **utter confusion of life and the certainty of death**.

#### What Truly Matters  

We **do not** have to achieve everything to have a meaningful life.  

Instead:  
- We should **care for others**.  
- We should **care for peace**.  
- We should **care for the planet**.  

We should slowly loosen the **mask of importance** and soften the **shield of ego**. We should try to impact lives, however small that impact may be.  

One day, we too will be **dead and forgotten**, like the tree that was cut down to build the house we live in.  

So, let’s just **pause** for a moment.  
Let’s **think inward**.  
Let’s be **thankful for our existence**.  

And let’s just enjoy our own cup of **coffee**.

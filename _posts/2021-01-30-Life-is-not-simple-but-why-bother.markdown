description: Just some random thoughts.
---

While growing up, we all go through a lot of phases. We plan things, some work and some do not. Some are half-filled, some are half-baked, and some are not even attempted. Many a time, when things don't happen according to our plans and thoughts, we start to think "Oh, it's over." But, in reality, it isn't. These thoughts are some emotional reaction to the situation that we are in, which are essentially limited and restricted in many different ways, mostly "perspectives". Then comes the thoughts about being right or wrong. For what it matters, is there a way to stop such thoughts? Because these thoughts are just "thoughts". These thoughts are only some complex random interactions of the nerve cells in the brain. We need to steer this process so that it starts wheeling in a right direction rather than diverting us to the path called "The Illusion of Choices" (a small blog that I will post soon).

We may sometimes be right in our own perspectives, but we may be utterly wrong in someone else's. But should we care? It is not our job to be a sunset to make others happy; neither do we have to become a lost key found in one of our old washed jeans. We are not here to make everyone happy. We are here to live, we are here to celebrate life, we are here to spread love, and most importantly, we are here to take care of ourselves while we can selfishly. At the time, life may seem so unfair and hard; but hey, why care. Just enjoy the present and believe me, it's worth living in the present.

Once we start leaving expectations aside, we begin to live in the present; we begin to look at things as they are, without any prejudices and preconceived notions. We waste a large part of our life trying to please others and fulfil their expectations rather than taking care of our own body, mind, and soul. Expectations of people change like the colours on our face during Holi.

Life is too short; do what makes you happy and satisfied. Take out time for yourself, read a book you love, watch the movie you have skipped many times due to your busy work schedule, go for a ride along the country roads, go for a swim in your favourite beach, cook what you only could imagine but never tried cooking, visit the best restaurant and order the most expensive dish there in, call your parents and say how much you love them and that you would take care of them no matter what, call that friend of yours with who you fought during your childhood and stopped talking after, and most importantly just go in front of the mirror look at the person in front of you in the eyes and say "I love you and I mean it".


Take care of yourself and remember:
<blockquote>
    Life is only unfair if you think it is unfair.
